# Visual-Detection-Halcon
This is a program that uses visual detection to identify goods that have defects, using C# and Halcon.

What you can learn from the code:

1. How to communicate with a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)
2. How to use C# to create a user interface (UI)
3. How to use Halcon for image detection
4. How to design a geometry on the screen that can be controlled by a mouse

To use this program:

1. Copy the "detectionData" package to your C:/ drive. This is necessary because my industrial computer only has the C:/ drive.
2. Open the "wheelDetection.sln" file.
3. 
I have forgotten most details about the project since it was something I worked on during my sophomore year."
